# CSCI495

## Description / Purpose
This is a front-end mock up of what a full website could on e day be like. 
I have makde this for a what could be a coffee shop that coastal could possibly one day have. 
It could be a competative webiste to starbucks essentially.
The animations and background videos makes it a website for the easily entertainable, that way it will be able to catch attention easily. 

## Dependencies
autoprefixer: v. 9.6.1,
concat:       v. 1.0.3,
node-sass:    v. 4.12.0,
npm-run-all:  v. 4.1.5,
postcss-cli:  v. 6.1.3

## Usage
Just have to open on a liver-server of download the files to view on borwser locally.

## Future Work
Well, once this website is completely operational from the front-end I could then just take a few extra steps to connect to a database using a little Node.js and maybe PHP if I wanted to use an outdated, yet simple language. Then my database could be in MySQL if i wanted or NoSQL. Finally, after all of that, I could have created a geoloactional service to locate the closest store near them so an orer could be processed romatel and be sent to the store to complete before the customer got there. 

## What is your major and how this project is related to your major.
I am a computer information systems major and we have learned quite a bit about webdevelopment but not as much as I have learened and am currently learning on my own. We touched upon back end webdevelopment more than front-end but for my career goals, being a full-stack webdeveloper is what I need. Therefore, I have gone into learning more about front-end development such as SASS, SCSS, and npm. I am also in the process of learning Javascript more in depth so that can also be incorperated into my future projects.
