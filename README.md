# CSCI495
### Rapid Development Cycle One

## Description/Purpose
This project is essentially just a front-end mock up of what could be a larger website when connected ot a database and even a geolocation. The purpose of this website is essentially to show that there are a lot of transformations and translations you can do with just css and very little html. I used SASS and SCSS to create these animations and such to make the page look good and these preprocessors make it easy to view the css in like a nested view. 

## Dependencies
autoprefixer: 9.6.1, concat: 1.0.3, node-sass: 4.12.0, npm-run-all: 4.1.5, postcss-cli: 6.1.3

## Usage
This page can be used currently as a info website if some of the info I actually made actually changed these word words instead of lorem ispem. I've made this to show what I can do on the front-end with just two langauges.

## Future Development
This website can soon be connected to a database later on to connect information logged in to get benefits and geolocation to order drinks from this site from the closest store and have it completed. On top of these things, they will also be able to get a news letter weekly if they wanted to and they will also be able to see their recent drinks and able to order them again from that list.
